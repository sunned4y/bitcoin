Ideoblock Core
==============

What is Ideoblock?
----------------

Ideoblock is a new and contemporary form of cryptocurrency based off the popular
cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The theroy is that insted of mining for 'coins' you are 
actually mining for 'blocks' or 'bars'. Now, considering that most cryptocurrencies 
are finite and have a limited resource; Ideoblocks follow the same sort of principal. 
The more miners, the harder it gets to mine 1 block.

If you would like to know more you will soon be able to view our Wiki.
 (Still currently in development!!)

Why not Bitcoin?
----------------

As we said before, Ideoblocking follows the same type of principals that Bitcoin does, but the
diffrence is that

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Paycoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[TalkXPY forum](https://www.talkxpy.com/category/8/paycoin-coincode)

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/PaycoinFoundation/paycoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Paycoin.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Paycoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/paycoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
